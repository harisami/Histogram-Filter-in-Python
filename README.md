## Histogram Filter in Python

### Two Dimensional Histogram Filter - Feature and Bug

###### we will go through this project in a few parts:
###### 1) Explore the Code - The goal is to get a feel for how this code base is organized and what everything does.
###### 2) Implement a Feature - write code that gets the robot moving correctly.
###### 3) Fix a Bug - Implementing motion will reveal a bug which hadn't shown up before. Here we'll identify what the bug is and take steps to reproduce it. Then we'll identify the cause and fix it.
